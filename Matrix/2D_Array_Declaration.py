# First Method
arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Second Method
arr1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# To find the number of rows and columns in the first method (using list of lists)
rows = len(arr)
cols = len(arr[0])

# To find the number of rows and columns in the second method (using list of lists)
rows1 = len(arr1)

# Printing results
print("First Method")

print("\nSecond Method")
